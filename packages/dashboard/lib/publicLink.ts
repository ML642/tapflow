/**
 * Addresses the dashboard hands to someone else: a link a teammate opens, and the relay address an
 * agent on another Mac connects to. Built here and nowhere else (#788).
 *
 * **The relay decides what its settings mean; this file only falls back.** `/api/v1/relay/host` reports
 * `publicBaseUrl` (where a teammate's browser goes: a started tunnel, else `relay.url`) and
 * `agentRelayUrl` (`relay.url` alone). They are separate because an agent on the relay's own LAN must not
 * stream through a tunnel, so a link and the agent command can name different hosts. See
 * `packages/relay/src/lib/publicUrl.ts`.
 *
 * **When the relay offers nothing,** a viewer on localhost gets the relay's LAN address — their own
 * address is the one place a teammate cannot reach — and any other viewer keeps the address they are
 * already using, which is known to work. The relay withholds its LAN guess inside a container, where the
 * only candidate is a bridge address nobody can open.
 *
 * `useRelay` does not come here: it connects this page to its own relay, and the browser's own origin is
 * the right answer for that.
