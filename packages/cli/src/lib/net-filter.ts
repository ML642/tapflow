  // restart landed on a session that was already disabled and cost two probes out of 468. On
  // 2026-09-02, with no disable anywhere in this path, the same notification landed on an *enabled*
  // session, armed Drop-All twice, and the plugin was disposed with nothing restarting it: 2m34s with
  // no network on the Mac, ended by a reboot.
  //
  // 69ms is a race won, not a margin. The notification trails the copy by about 130ms and the copy is
  // the slow part, so a slower disk or a larger bundle reorders them and the 2026-09-02 shape is back.
  // Disabling first removes the race rather than winning it.
  //
  // **From `shipped`, and that is the whole reason this is safe now when it was not before.** The

  // installed, and a build older than the flag does not refuse it — every unrecognised argument fell
  // through to `.configure`, which writes `isEnabled = true`, so "switch off" switched it on and
  // answered 0. The binary here is the one this package ships and always understands the flag.
  // Measured 2026-09-03: run from the package directory it disabled the **existing** configuration
  // (same `NEFilterManager` UUID, session `disconnected — Configuration was disabled`) rather than
  // creating a second one, and the heartbeat file went away. `/Applications` is required for
  // *system-extension activation*, not for `NEFilterManager`.
  //

  // kernel-wide drop: `applyIPDefaultDrop: IP Drop-All enabled <Last>`, `Persistent IP Drop-All level
  // <5>`. So the symptom is an instant `No route to host` on every new connection, in 1–2ms, rather
  // than the hang the shape of the problem suggests — worth knowing before reading a bug report about
  // it, because someone looking for stuck sockets will not find any.
  //
  // Reconstructed from the unified log for 2026-09-02: the replace stopped the plugin at 14:01:56
  // with nothing restarting it, the armed drop stayed armed, and the Mac had no network for 2m34s
  // until a restart (`nesessionmanager` pid 381 → 403 at 14:04:30). Disabling first means the session
  // is already down when the activation touches it, and a disabled configuration takes the drop back
  // down with it.
  //
  // What is left is the window while the filter comes back up, measured across ~300 probes: about
  // four seconds of raised latency (10-30ms to 200-400ms) and **no failures**, because the kernel
  // passes traffic a provider has not applied settings for yet. Measured again through a real
  // extension replace on 2026-09-03: 2 failed probes out of 468, and the whole command took 2.8s.
  //
  // **This is the second disable, and it is the one that gates the activation.** The first ran before
  // the copy, from `shipped`, against the installed-apps notification `ditto` triggers; see there for
  // why that one is best-effort and this one is not.
  //
  // Both exist because they answer different things. That one is about a *restart* macOS performs on
  // its own timing, so it has to be earlier than an event nothing here controls. This one is about the
  // *activation* on the line below, which is ours, so it can be immediately before it — and it must be
  // the last word, because the window between here and `--install` is the one thing this function is
  // ordering. The earlier call may also have found nothing to do: a Mac with no filter installed yet
  // has no configuration to switch off, and the copy is what makes the rest of this possible.
  //
  // Asking the binary the copy just landed keeps working the way it always did — it is the one that
  // understands the flag, and it is there because `ditto` put it there. A build older than the flag
  // does not refuse it (every unrecognised argument fell through to `.configure`, which writes
  // `isEnabled = true`), which is why neither call asks whatever happened to be installed already.
  //
  // `--install` turns it back on by itself: with no `--add`/`--remove` it takes `clearAll`, and
  // `configureFilter` ends with `isEnabled = true`. So there is no re-enable step to forget.
